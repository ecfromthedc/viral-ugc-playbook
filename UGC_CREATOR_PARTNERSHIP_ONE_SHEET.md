## The Real Game

**What matters:** Median views, not followers.
**What works:** Systems, not guessing.
**What you need:** Volume + consistency.

## The System (5 Steps)

### 1. Train Your Algorithm
- Find 5-10 top creators in your niche
- Sort their content by "Most Liked"
- Favorite 5-10 of their best posts each
- Your FYP will now show you winning content patterns

### 2. The Slingshot Method
TikTok tracks: **viral sound** + **viral words** = pattern.

When you use viral words on a viral sound, the algorithm slingshots your post harder than the original.

95% of fast-growing pages do this. It's not stealing—it's pattern extension.

### 3. Daily Workflow
**Morning (15-30 min):**
- Scroll FYP
- Identify 15 viral slingshots
- Stack in drafts

**All day:**
- Post every 45 minutes
- Repeat until drafts are gone

**That's it.** Scroll → Stack → Post.

### 4. Speed Control Cheat Code
TikTok has speed controls (3x, 2x, 1x, 0.5x, 0.3x):
- **Speed up:** Record slow → TikTok makes it fast/energetic
- **Slow down:** Record fast → TikTok makes it smooth/cinematic

Zero editing. Maximum effect.

### 5. What Gets You Booked
Not followers. **Median views.**

50K followers + 500K median views > 200K followers + 10K median views.

## How We Work Together

### You Get:
1. **This playbook** (implement it yourself or with my support)
2. **Campaign bookings** from Atlantic, Warner, Sony, indie labels
3. **Optional deal management** (we handle inquiries, you create)
4. **Network access** to other top creators + ongoing optimization

### The Exchange:
**Preferred rates on campaigns I book you:**
- $5-$20/post (based on your median views)
- High volume = consistent income
- Example: 50-100 posts/month = $250-$2,000/month baseline
- You keep 100% of your own inbound deals
- No exclusivity

**The math:**
- Charging $50/post but getting 2-3 bookings/month = $100-$300
- Charging $5-$20/post but getting 50-100 bookings/month = $250-$2,000

Volume beats variance.

### Non-Negotiables:
- You own your page, content, and audience
- No exclusivity required
- You can take outside deals anytime
- Partnership, not ownership

## Quick FAQ

**Exclusive?** No. Keep all your outside deals at 100%.

**Cost?** Nothing. The playbook is free. Value exchange = preferred rates on campaigns I send.

**How many campaigns?** Depends on your performance and my pipeline. Could be 10/month, could be 100+.

**Can I opt out?** Yes. Partnership, not a contract.

**Why free?** Better creators = better network = everyone wins.
